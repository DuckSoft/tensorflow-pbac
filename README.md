A Naive Tensorflow Implementation of "Phase-Based Active Contour" Model (PBAC)

## Introduction
This is a naive implementation of paper [Cai L, Wang Y. A phase-based active contour model for segmentation of breast ultrasound images. In: *Int Conf Biomed Eng Info*; 2013: 91-95](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6746913/), which serves as a component code in repetition of paper [Automatic tumor segmentation in breast ultrasound images using a dilated fully convolutional network combined with an active contour model](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mp.13268).
